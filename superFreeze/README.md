##### What is superFreeze and what does it do?

superFreeze is a Minecraft (Bukkit/Spigot) plugin that allows staff to freeze players if they suspect for example that they are cheating so that you can screen share them. It has many options for how you would like to notify that player.

##### Why choose superFreeze over other Freeze plugins?

The reason to choose superFreeze is that it's a plugin that tells the player that their frozen in such a unique way and can support many players at once. superFreeze also has a lot of configuration. Remember though, superFreeze is still in Beta and we are taking suggestions, so please report bugs and suggest away!
